Emag Price Tracker and Database
I built a program in Python to track prices and create my own database of products I was interested in from Emag, the Romanian version of Amazon. I created a GUI using Tkinter and through web scrapping I gathered the information I needed. Then I added it to my database using Pandas. As a result, the product is saved in the database and you are able to check the highest and lowest price and even display a graph to see the evolution of the price.
